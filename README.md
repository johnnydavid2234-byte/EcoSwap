# ♻️ EcoSwap: Decentralized Community Waste Exchange

Welcome to EcoSwap, a blockchain-powered dApp that tackles the real-world problem of waste management by enabling communities to exchange reusable materials! In a world drowning in waste, this project promotes circular economy principles, reduces landfill contributions, and incentivizes sustainable behavior using the Stacks blockchain. Users can list, discover, and swap items like plastics, electronics, textiles, or organic waste, all while earning rewards and building trust through transparent, decentralized mechanisms.

## ✨ Features

♻️ List reusable materials with details like type, quantity, and condition  
🔍 Search and match swaps based on needs and location preferences  
🔒 Secure escrow for fair exchanges without intermediaries  
🏆 Reward tokens for successful swaps to encourage participation  
📊 Reputation system to build trust among users  
🗳️ Community governance for platform rules and upgrades  
⚖️ Dispute resolution for handling mismatches or issues  
📈 Analytics dashboard for tracking community impact  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Users (Swappers)**

- Register your profile with basic info (e.g., location for local matches)
- List your reusable materials by providing details and uploading proof (e.g., photos via IPFS integration)
- Browse or search for items you need, propose a swap, and agree on terms
- Initiate the swap: Items are held in escrow until both parties confirm delivery/receipt
- Complete the swap to earn EcoTokens and boost your reputation

**For Verifiers/Community Members**

- Verify listings or swaps through community voting or oracle integrations
- Participate in governance proposals to improve the platform
- Use analytics to see total waste diverted from landfills in your community

That's it! A seamless, trustless way to turn waste into resources, powered by blockchain for immutability and incentives.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

This project is built using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain and involves 8 smart contracts for modularity and security:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles user registration, profiles, and authentication.
2. **ItemListing.clar**: Manages listing, updating, and delisting of reusable materials with metadata storage.
3. **SwapMatching.clar**: Facilitates proposing, matching, and accepting swap offers between users.
4. **EscrowContract.clar**: Secures assets (tokens or NFTs representing items) during swaps until confirmation.
5. **EcoToken.clar**: A fungible token contract for rewarding users upon successful exchanges.
6. **ReputationSystem.clar**: Tracks user scores based on completed swaps, disputes, and community feedback.
7. **Governance.clar**: Enables DAO-style voting for platform parameters, like reward rates or fees.
8. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Allows raising disputes, community arbitration, and resolution with token penalties/rewards.

These contracts interact seamlessly to create a robust, decentralized ecosystem for waste exchanges.
